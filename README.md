# AWS S3 Versioning and CRR (Cross Region Replication) Notes

1) Versioning Hands-on

a)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Suspend versioning → Upload object → Delete object → Can you bring it back?
✅ No, you cannot bring it back.
Reason: When versioning is suspended, S3 treats objects like non-versioned ones. On delete, the object is permanently gone unless a version ID exists (but here, none was created under suspended versioning).

b)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Upload file1 → Suspend versioning → Upload file2 → Delete file2 → Can you bring file2 back?
✅ No, you cannot bring file2 back.
Reason: After suspending versioning, newly uploaded file2 has no version ID. Deleting it deletes it completely.

c)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Upload file1 → Suspend versioning → Upload file2 → Delete file1 → Can you bring file1 back?
✅ Yes, you can bring file1 back.
Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was enabled. It has a version ID. When you delete, it creates a "delete marker," but you can delete the delete marker and restore file1.

d)Create bucket → Upload file1 → Enable versioning → Upload file2 → Delete file1 → Can you bring file1 back?
❌ No, file1 cannot be brought back.
Reason: file1 was uploaded before enabling versioning (non-versioned), so deletion removes it permanently.

e)Create bucket → Upload file1 → Enable versioning → Upload file2 → Delete file2 → Can you bring file2 back?
✅ Yes, you can bring file2 back.
Reason: file2 was uploaded after versioning was enabled, so it has a version ID. Deletion adds a delete marker — removing it restores file2.

f)Create bucket → Upload file1 → Enable versioning → Upload file2 → Suspend versioning → Delete file1 → Can you bring file1 back?
❌ No, you cannot bring file1 back.
Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was suspended (non-versioned), so deleting it wipes it out permanently.

g)Create bucket → Upload file1 → Enable versioning → Upload file2 → Suspend versioning → Delete file2 → Can you bring file2 back?
✅ Yes, you can bring file2 back.
Reason: file2 was uploaded during active versioning. Even after suspension, old versions remain. Deleting places a delete marker; you can delete the marker to bring back file2.

h)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Upload file1 → Suspend versioning → Upload file2 → Enable versioning → Upload file3 → Suspend versioning → Delete file1 → Can you bring file1 back?
✅ Yes, you can bring file1 back.
Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was enabled. Delete marker will be created on delete. You can remove the marker and restore file1.

i)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Upload file1 → Suspend versioning → Upload file2 → Enable versioning → Upload file3 → Suspend versioning → Delete file2 → Can you bring file2 back?
❌ No, you cannot bring file2 back.
Reason: file2 was uploaded when versioning was suspended, so it was a non-versioned object. Deletion is permanent.

j)Create bucket → Enable versioning → Upload file1 → Suspend versioning → Upload file2 → Enable versioning → Upload file3 → Suspend versioning → Delete file3 → Can you bring file3 back?
✅ Yes, you can bring file3 back.
Reason: file3 was uploaded when versioning was active. Even after suspension, the version is saved. You can recover file3 by deleting the delete marker.

## 2) S3 Bucket Public/Private
Create a bucket → Make S3 bucket public → Upload an object → Make the object public → Now change the object back to private
✅ Yes, you can change the object back to private.

You either:
Remove public ACL from the object manually
OR add a bucket policy/object ACL denying public access
After doing this, the object becomes private again.

## 3) Is it necessary to delete the contents of an S3 bucket to delete the S3 bucket? How can you delete a bucket?
✅ Yes, it is necessary.
S3 does not allow deleting a bucket unless it is empty.
Steps to delete a bucket:
Delete all objects (and all object versions if versioning was enabled).
Then, delete the bucket.

If versioning is enabled, you must also delete all versions + delete markers.

## 4) What is the significance of creating an S3 bucket in a particular region?
✅ Lower latency: If your users are in India, use Mumbai region for faster access.
✅ Cost optimization: Some regions are cheaper than others.
✅ Compliance: Some data must stay in specific regions due to legal rules (example: Europe GDPR).
✅ Disaster Recovery: You may want buckets in different regions for backup.

4.1) Demonstrate CRR (Cross Region Replication) — North Virginia ➡️ Mumbai
Simple CRR Steps:
Create Source bucket in North Virginia (us-east-1).
Create Destination bucket in Mumbai (ap-south-1).
Enable versioning on both buckets (important!).
Go to Source Bucket → Management → Replication → Add rule:
Choose: Replicate all objects (or a prefix if needed).
Destination: Choose the Mumbai bucket.
IAM Role: Allow S3 to replicate.

Save rule.
✅ Now, whenever you upload an object into the North Virginia bucket, it automatically gets copied into the Mumbai bucket.

## 5) If you change your source bucket to private and destination bucket to private, will CRR still work?
✅ Yes, CRR will still work.
CRR works based on IAM permissions and replication rules.
Public/Private settings (ACL) don't affect replication working.
Only bucket permissions for replication IAM role matter.

## 6) If you change your source bucket to public and destination bucket to private, will CRR still work?
✅ Yes, CRR will still work.
Again, replication is internal AWS service-to-service, not dependent on public/private settings.
Only replication rule permissions and versioning are important.

## 7) If you change your source bucket to public and destination bucket to public, will CRR still work?
✅ Yes, CRR will still work.
Public access or private access doesn't impact CRR replication.
However, public buckets are not recommended unless absolutely needed (due to security risks).

## 8) If you change the object in the source bucket to public, will it automatically be public in the destination bucket too?
❌ No, it will not automatically become public.
When CRR replicates an object:
It copies the data.
It does not copy the ACLs (like public/private settings).
So, the object in destination bucket remains private unless you manually change it.

## 9) What happens if you change the object in the source bucket to private?
It will NOT automatically change anything in the destination bucket.
CRR (Cross Region Replication) only replicates actions like object creation (and optionally delete markers if delete replication is enabled).
If you update permissions later (like making an object private), it does NOT sync those permission changes to the destination.

## 10) What happens if you change the object (which came via CRR) in destination bucket to public? Will it impact the CRR property in any way?
No, it won't impact CRR.
Destination objects are independent once copied.

If you make the object public at destination, it stays public there — CRR doesn't control or revert it.

## 11) What happens when you delete the object from the source bucket? Would it be deleted in the destination bucket also?
Normally, no, deleting from the source does not delete from destination.
Exception: If you have Replication of Delete Markers enabled and versioning is ON, then delete markers can be replicated — making the object "appear deleted" in the destination too.

## 12) What happens when you delete the object from the destination bucket? Would it be deleted in the source bucket also?
No, deleting from destination does NOT affect the source bucket.
CRR is one-way — from source to destination only, not the reverse.

## 13) What happens when you disable/suspend versioning in the destination bucket? Will CRR still work?
No, CRR requires versioning to be enabled in the destination bucket.
If you suspend versioning, replication stops working for new objects.

## 14) What happens when you disable/suspend versioning in the source bucket? Will CRR still work?
No, CRR requires versioning to be enabled in the source bucket too.
If you suspend versioning in the source, replication stops for new uploads.

## 15) Create a bucket → create a folder → upload an object in that folder
👉 Steps:

Go to S3 console → Create bucket (example: my-bucket).
Open the bucket → Click Create folder (example: my-folder/).
Inside the folder, click Upload → Select your file → Upload.
✅ Done! The object will be stored with a key like: my-folder/myfile.jpg.

16) Enable versioning by default when you create an S3 bucket
When creating the bucket, after setting the bucket name and region:
Go to "Bucket Versioning" section →
Choose Enable versioning before finishing creation.
✅ Now versioning will be ON by default when the bucket is created.
