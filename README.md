# S3-Interview-Q-A

# AWS S3 Versioning and CRR (Cross Region Replication) Notes

1) Versioning Hands-on
a)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload object ‚Üí Delete object ‚Üí Can you bring it back?
‚úÖ No, you cannot bring it back.

Reason: When versioning is suspended, S3 treats objects like non-versioned ones. On delete, the object is permanently gone unless a version ID exists (but here, none was created under suspended versioning).

b)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Delete file2 ‚Üí Can you bring file2 back?
‚úÖ No, you cannot bring file2 back.

Reason: After suspending versioning, newly uploaded file2 has no version ID. Deleting it deletes it completely.

c)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Delete file1 ‚Üí Can you bring file1 back?
‚úÖ Yes, you can bring file1 back.

Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was enabled. It has a version ID. When you delete, it creates a "delete marker," but you can delete the delete marker and restore file1.

d)

Create bucket ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Delete file1 ‚Üí Can you bring file1 back?
‚ùå No, file1 cannot be brought back.

Reason: file1 was uploaded before enabling versioning (non-versioned), so deletion removes it permanently.

e)

Create bucket ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Delete file2 ‚Üí Can you bring file2 back?
‚úÖ Yes, you can bring file2 back.

Reason: file2 was uploaded after versioning was enabled, so it has a version ID. Deletion adds a delete marker ‚Äî removing it restores file2.

f)

Create bucket ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Delete file1 ‚Üí Can you bring file1 back?
‚ùå No, you cannot bring file1 back.

Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was suspended (non-versioned), so deleting it wipes it out permanently.

g)

Create bucket ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Delete file2 ‚Üí Can you bring file2 back?
‚úÖ Yes, you can bring file2 back.

Reason: file2 was uploaded during active versioning. Even after suspension, old versions remain. Deleting places a delete marker; you can delete the marker to bring back file2.

h)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file3 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Delete file1 ‚Üí Can you bring file1 back?
‚úÖ Yes, you can bring file1 back.

Reason: file1 was uploaded when versioning was enabled. Delete marker will be created on delete. You can remove the marker and restore file1.

i)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file3 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Delete file2 ‚Üí Can you bring file2 back?
‚ùå No, you cannot bring file2 back.

Reason: file2 was uploaded when versioning was suspended, so it was a non-versioned object. Deletion is permanent.

j)

Create bucket ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file1 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Upload file2 ‚Üí Enable versioning ‚Üí Upload file3 ‚Üí Suspend versioning ‚Üí Delete file3 ‚Üí Can you bring file3 back?
‚úÖ Yes, you can bring file3 back.

Reason: file3 was uploaded when versioning was active. Even after suspension, the version is saved. You can recover file3 by deleting the delete marker.

## 2) Create a bucket -> Make S3 bucket public -> Upload object -> Make the object public -> Change object back to private
- Initially the object is public.
- You can change permissions anytime and make it private by modifying **ACL** or **bucket policy**.
- **Public access can be revoked.**

---

## 3) Is it necessary to delete the contents of an S3 bucket to delete the bucket?
- ‚úÖ **Yes.**
- You must delete **all objects**, **all versions**, and **delete markers** if versioning was enabled.
- After that, you can delete the bucket.

**Steps to delete a bucket:**
- Delete all objects manually or use "Empty Bucket" option.
- Delete bucket.

---

## 4) Significance of creating an S3 bucket in a particular region
- ‚úÖ **Lower latency**: Data is closer to the users.
- ‚úÖ **Cost optimization**: Pricing differs across regions.
- ‚úÖ **Compliance and Legal requirements**: (e.g., GDPR).
- ‚úÖ **Disaster recovery planning**: Multi-region backups.

---

## 4.1) Demonstrate CRR (Cross Region Replication)
**Scenario:**
- Source Bucket: North Virginia (`us-east-1`)
- Destination Bucket: Mumbai (`ap-south-1`)

**Steps:**
1. Create source bucket (North Virginia) and destination bucket (Mumbai).
2. Enable **versioning** on both buckets.
3. Go to **Source bucket -> Management -> Replication -> Create Rule**.
4. Replicate all objects (or specific prefixes if required).
5. Assign necessary IAM role permissions.

**Result:** Objects uploaded in source bucket are **automatically copied** to the destination bucket.

---

## 5) If source bucket is private and destination bucket is private, will CRR work?
- ‚úÖ **Yes.**
- CRR depends on IAM permissions and replication configuration, not on public/private settings.

## 6) If source bucket is public and destination bucket is private, will CRR work?
- ‚úÖ **Yes.**
- Same as above, replication is internal and based on configured rules.

## 7) If source bucket is public and destination bucket is public, will CRR work?
- ‚úÖ **Yes.**
- Public access settings do not impact CRR functioning.

## 8) If you change the object in the source bucket to public, will it automatically be public in the destination bucket?
- ‚ùå **No.**
- CRR **does not replicate ACLs** (Access Control Lists).
- The replicated object remains **private** unless manually changed.

### (Optional) CLI Practice Tip
If you want to practice quickly:
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
aws s3api put-bucket-replication --bucket <source-bucket> --replication-configuration file://replication.json
```

Where `replication.json` contains the replication rules.
